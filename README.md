## Background

Dim Cooking is a cooking website centered around Dim Sum while also drawing heavy inspiration from the NYT Cooking website. Users can participate in an online community of Dim Sum enthusiasts using the site to view, save and discuss their methods for cooking these recipes. In order to participate in the community, users can create an account, sign in and even test out the site as a demo user. Once logged in, users can then save recipes to their specific recipe box associated with their account, as well as share cooking notes with other cooks. These notes can also be edited and deleted by the user who created them.
